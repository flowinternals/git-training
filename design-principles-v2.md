- we dont regress any functionality when we make a new change
- we dont add new code to the index.html, instead we update the appropriate modules/components
- we keep comments, debugging and console logging to a minimum and cleanup when they are no longer required
- no bandaid or patch fixes - instead we follow good architectural refactoring practices
- we update the design, PRD and readme.md files with important changes
- ALWAYS stick to the prime directive of optimising the codebase
- we have single implementations - no fallbacks or backwards compatibility
- always suggest tests after a change
- do not fix random issues you think are a problem along the journey. You just cause additional regressions. Stay focused on the problem at hand.
- do not update a bug with a fix until AFTER its been successfully user tested and confirmed fixed
- do NOT overengineer a solution. If I ask for a simple feature,  keep it simple, stay focused and do not do anymore than what is asked.- we dont regress any functionality when we make a new change

- auto-switch mcp accounts when changing projects. refer to firebase-mcp-auto-switching-guide.md
- Run secrets-scanning before major commits to github. If secrets scanning has not been setup, remind the user of that fact.
- Secrets in env files only, no secrets in code/commits.
- Dependency policy (pin, audit cadence, vulnerability SLAs)
- Data handling: PII minimisation, logging redaction, retention
- Error handling conventions (no silent catches, user-safe messages)
- Logging levels and structure; no debug logs in prod
- Regularly update PRD/design/readme. Dont put commercially sensitive information in the publically available readme.md
